What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a git(hidden) file in the directory, which will be used to store metadata about commits. Without this file, there will nothing to trackback our files to previous version.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Files are added to staging area from working directory to make commits to repository where all the commits resides. Staging gives you the power to commit only those files which you want to. You can also delete files from staging area after adding, if you feel you dont want to commit that file now. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can see the difference between your staging files and the most recent commit files. This will tell you if you are making one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When you want to develop an experimental feature, do changes to same functions that are not needed/task. Branches can help in creating these features without disrupting the flow of our main project. If I wanted to add those features in the main branch I can merge it in future.
